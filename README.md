# Coding Tracker

Coding Tracker is a simple console application, made in C#, that will allow you to track coding sessions. It allows you 
to input a start time, which defaults to the time when you start the insertion, as well as an end time, which defaults 
to the time at which you're inputting it. It will calculate the duration for you, and will allow you to see basic 
information about past sessions, as well as give you the ability to update or delete them.
